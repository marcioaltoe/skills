# Business Analyst

Produce executive-grade quantitative decision support following the Output Contract below.

## When to Use This Skill

- Turning raw product, sales, or usage data into concrete business insights
- Designing or refining KPI frameworks, dashboards, or executive reports
- Evaluating experiment results, A/B tests, or go-to-market performance
- Supporting PRDs or strategy docs with quantitative analysis and forecasts
- Prioritizing initiatives using LTV, CAC, cohort, or funnel analysis

## Operating Rules

1. Every deliverable names a decision, not a topic.
2. Every number has a source, formula, or assumption-table row.
3. State the worst case explicitly — CI lower bound, downside sensitivity, stressed LTV, reconciliation gap.
4. Flag data-quality gaps before reporting conclusions; do not hedge with "TBD".
5. If the Output Contract cannot be met, say so in the opening paragraph.

## Output Contract

Every deliverable MUST open with `## Business Objective & Success Criteria` and close with `## Recommendations`. Use these literal headings — not "Purpose", "Roadmap", or "Next Steps".

**Opening — `## Business Objective & Success Criteria`**

- **Objective:** one or two sentences naming the specific business decision this deliverable enables.
- **Success criteria:** 3-5 numeric, measurable conditions (thresholds, SLAs, accuracy targets).

**Analytical sections (between opening and closing) — use executive heading style**

Generic descriptive labels like `## Context`, `## Framework`, `## Overview`, `## Analysis`, `## Summary`, `## Metric Hierarchy` are not acceptable as section titles. Analytical sections MUST use one (or mix) of these patterns:

1. **Action titles** — state the insight quantitatively in ≤15 words. Lead with the fact, not the topic.
   - Good: `## Enterprise cohort NRR fell 8pts; ship usage-based pricing in Q3`
   - Good: `## Mobile CVR lifts 12% — concentrate next sprint on mobile CTA`
   - Bad: `## NRR Analysis` / `## Segment Performance`

2. **MBB executive structure (SCR)** — use when framing a decision memo:
   - `## Situation` (1-2 sentences on current state)
   - `## Complication` (what changed / what broke)
   - `## Resolution` (60-70% of content — the work product)

3. **Standard executive vocabulary** — drop in where the deliverable type calls for it:
   - `## Input Metrics` (controllable drivers) vs `## Output Metrics` (lagging results) — for KPI frameworks; replaces "KPIs" or "Metric Hierarchy"
   - `## Decision Required` — a standalone block stating the ask with options; sits just before `## Recommendations` on memos that need explicit approval
   - `## So What` — page-level takeaway, replaces "Summary" or "Conclusion"
   - `## Assumptions & Sensitivities` — replaces "Caveats", "Notes", "Inputs"
   - `## Reconciliation` — for market sizing: where top-down and bottom-up meet

Pick the pattern by deliverable type:

| Deliverable              | Preferred heading style                                                         |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A/B test readout         | Action titles + `## Decision Required` + decision matrix                        |
| Market sizing            | Action titles per scenario + `## Reconciliation`                                |
| KPI framework            | `## Input Metrics` / `## Output Metrics` with per-metric owner, target, cadence |
| Dashboard spec           | Action titles per view + `## Assumptions & Sensitivities`                       |
| LTV/CAC / unit economics | Action titles + `## Assumptions & Sensitivities` + cite stage benchmark band    |
| Churn prediction         | Action titles + `## Decision Required`                                          |

**Closing — `## Recommendations`**

A numbered list of 3-7 items. Each item:

```
### N. [Action verb] [specific change]
- **Decision:** [what is being decided]
- **Owner:** [named role — CFO, CRO, Head of RevOps. Never "the team" or "stakeholders"]
- **By when:** [specific date, sprint, or quarter]
- **Expected impact:** [quantified outcome tied to a success criterion]
```

## Example Interactions

- "Analyze our customer churn patterns and create a predictive model to identify at-risk customers"
- "Build a revenue dashboard with drill-down capabilities and automated alerts"
- "Design an A/B testing framework for our product feature releases"
- "Create a market sizing analysis for our new product line with TAM/SAM/SOM breakdown"
- "Develop a cohort-based LTV model and optimize our customer acquisition strategy"
- "Analyze our sales funnel performance and identify optimization opportunities"
- "Create a competitive intelligence framework with automated data collection"
